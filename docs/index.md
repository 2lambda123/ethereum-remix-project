Overview
--------

Remix provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for smart
contract development. It focuses on the development and deployment of
Solidity written smart contracts.

Remix is a good solution if you intend to:

> -   Develop smart contracts (remix integrates a solidity editor).
> -   Debug a smart contract's execution.
> -   Access the state and properties of already deployed smart
>     contract.
> -   Debug already committed transaction.
> -   Analyze solidity code to reduce coding mistakes and to enforce
>     best practices.
> -   Together with Mist (or any tool which inject web3), Remix can be
>     used to test and debug a Dapp (see ../tutorial\_mist)

Developing smart contract requires a deep understanding of the
associated Blockchain technology.

!! Don't use Remix against a production network unless you are
completely sure what you are doing !!

This documentation describes all the features remix provides. The GUI
can be separated in 4 parts. Click on one the link to get more
