Welcome to Remix documentation!
===============================

Remix is a powerful, open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser.
Written in Javascript, Remix supports both usage in the browser or locally.

Remix also supports testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.

Our Remix project with all its features is available
